"""aiter (AMD AI Tensor Engine for ROCm) attention kernels.

Unlike the flex backend, aiter does not need its own SP-aware forward: it reuses
the FlashAttention adapter in ``flash.py`` and only swaps the underlying kernels.
This module therefore exposes a kernel-like object rather than an attention
forward, and ``flash._load_veomni_local_flash_kernel`` picks it up for the
``veomni_flash_attention_aiter_with_sp`` implementation name.

def build_aiter_flash_kernels() -> SimpleNamespace:
    """
    Build a kernel-like object backed by aiter's flash-attention kernels, adapted to
    the calling convention Transformers' ``_flash_attention_forward`` expects (i.e. it
    exposes ``flash_attn_func`` and ``flash_attn_varlen_func``).

    aiter's public API mirrors flash-attn but differs in three ways, absorbed here so
    the surrounding VeOmni/Transformers plumbing is unchanged:

    * the CK / FMHA-v3 forward asserts ``return_lse=True`` whenever autograd is enabled
      (it needs the log-sum-exp for the backward pass), so we always request it.
      Transformers already unwraps the returned ``(out, lse, ...)`` tuple via ``out[0]``
      in all three call sites.
    * ``window_size`` is a 3-tuple ``(left, right, sink)`` rather than a 2-tuple.
    * the varlen entry point names the softcap ``logits_soft_cap``; the dense entry
      point exposes no softcap argument at all, which this shim rejects explicitly
      rather than silently ignoring.

    The parameter names declared on the varlen shim are what Transformers'
    ``_lazy_define_process_function`` introspects to decide which optional kwargs
    (dropout, window, deterministic, softcap, max_seqlen) it forwards.
